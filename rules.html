        <h1>This game is very simple! What you do is try and complete the most challenges with a very low amount of advancements completed. If you are playing with another person, compare the amount of challenges and the one with the most completed wins! To Start Playing, Press the "Start" Button At The Top Right and a Textbox will appear. Finish the Challenge on Screen (Make sure you count the amount of advancements you completed) and type the amount of advancements completed in the textbox [Defaulted to 0] and press Continue.  Redo those steps and you have a full game!</h2>
